Prompt: Natural language inference
Consider the given context and following statements, then determine whether they are supported by the information present in the context.Provide a brief explanation for each statement before arriving at the verdict (Yes/No). Provide a final verdict for each statement in order at the end in the given format. Do not deviate from the specified format.

Context:\nJohn is a student at XYZ University. He is pursuing a degree in Computer Science. He is enrolled in several courses this semester, including Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Management. John is a diligent student and spends a significant amount of time studying and completing assignments. He often stays late in the library to work on his projects.
statements:\n1. John is majoring in Biology.\n2. John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.\n3. John is a dedicated student.\n4. John has a part-time job.\n5. John is interested in computer programming.\n
Answer:
1. John is majoring in Biology.
Explanation: John's major is explicitly mentioned as Computer Science. There is no information suggesting he is majoring in Biology.  Verdict: No.
2. John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.
Explanation: The context mentions the courses John is currently enrolled in, and Artificial Intelligence is not mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be deduced that John is taking a course on AI. Verdict: No.
