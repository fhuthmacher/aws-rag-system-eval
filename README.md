# RAG System Component Evaluation
    
This notebook is a follow up from the previous [notebook](https://github.com/fhuthmacher/LLMevaluation/blob/main/LLMInformationExtraction.ipynb) and [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUuO9eJbOTk) in which we explored the overall evaluation approach and a RAG system's overall accuracy.

This notebook we will take a closer look at specific RAG evaluation metrics and explore how different RAG components impact these RAG evaluation metrics.
